# Overview

This repository contains documentation and notes from the OHSINT Lab on TryHackMe. The lab focuses on using open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques to gather information from publicly available sources. It demonstrates how publicly shared content can reveal personal details, digital footprints, and investigative leads without the need for internal or private data.

# Objective

The main objective of the OHSINT Lab is to analyze digital information footprints by using publicly accessible platforms. It emphasizes systematic investigation using tools such as image metadata analysis, social media review, username tracking, and open-source lookup tools.

# Key Learnings

Understood how OSINT methodologies work and how to apply them in real-world investigations.
Learned how to extract meaningful information from social media profiles, images, and metadata.
Practiced using OSINT tools such as EXIF viewers, search engines, reverse image search, and online directories.
Identified how small pieces of information such as usernames, pictures, and locations can be connected to form a complete profile.
Recognized the importance of privacy awareness and how publicly posted information can be exploited.
